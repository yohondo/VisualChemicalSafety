# How to format your text

Markdown is a simple language used to add formatting to text. The guidelines platform uses a modified version of the Markdown syntax. It allows you to easily add bold, italics, links, lists, paragraphs, headers, and images to blocks of texts. You can also add tables.

| Formatting         | Keyboard shortcuts       | Markdown syntax                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Bold text          | Command/Ctrl + B         | `**text** or __text__`                   |
| Italic text        | Command/Ctrl + I         | `*text* or _text_`                       |
| Strikethrough text | Command/Ctrl + Shift + S | `~~text~~`                               |
| Links              | Command/Ctrl + K         | `[text](https://guidelines.fhft.nhs.uk)` |

## Special Characters

You can use all the special characters that modern devices can display. This could be emojis like this flag, 🇬🇧, but is more often used in clinical guidelines for things like ℃ and O₂.

For convenience, here are a range of common special characters you can copy and paste.

## Headings

```
# Page Title (Heading 1)

## Section Heading (Heading 2)

### Sub-Heading (Heading 3)

#### Heading 4
```

In the visual editor you can only use heading 3 and 4, as 1 and 2 are already being used with the page title and section heading.
